MASS COLLIDE
============


Lets make a particle system completly on the GPU.

When this is succesfully done, the plan is to link the particles together to make a huge softmesh.

The next step would be to program collition between particles and so be able to make solid soft meshes that can collide with each other!

Hope my computer can handle it!
